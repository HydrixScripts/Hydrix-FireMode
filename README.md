# updates
1.) ```currently adding in gui support and putting in keybindings through qbcore to add toggle keys so use of gui and keys are there for in depth or quick options for players.```

2.) ```taking time to implement a server side implementation of aiming and toggle firemode sounds so that players can hear (sound whore) in rp or realism servers```

3.) ```thinking of ways to implements more config options for multiple scenarios or instances for servers using diff frameworks```

4.) ```thinking of switching to svelte```

5.) ```thinking of making in depth support for custom weapon models rather than haging to config all of them make it possible to declare a stream folder / shared folders```
